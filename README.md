# TampermonkeyScripts

These are several of my personal Tampermonkey Scripts.

Some were coded by me while some were adapted by others.


## Fix Youtube Layout

This script disables 'polymer=1' on Youtube.com rendering the page in it's old format from pre 2018.

While the older format may not load as fast, it doesn't waste so much space like the new version.


## Twitch Latency on Player Controls

This script was written by Tuna Can: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/391680-twitch-latency-on-player-controls

I added the ability to show Bitrate beside the Latency.
